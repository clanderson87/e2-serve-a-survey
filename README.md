Survey MonkeyButt is a open source collaboration from TEAM QUESTIONPANTHER. The object is to create a Survey creator that doesn't deliver bad news. Three key features are:

* Creation of multiple choice, text response and single choice questions.
* Representation of data to the survey's creator.
* Emailing results.

Dependancies are handled via bower. First,
* ```cd lib```

Then:
* ```bower init```
* ```bower install jQuery```
* ```bower install angularfire```
* ```bower install angular```
* ```bower install bootstrap```
* ```bower install angular Filter```
* ```bower install angular Route```
* ```bower install materialize```
